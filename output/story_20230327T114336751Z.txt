He was born to a small tribe of humans who eked out a living in the wilderness. From a young age, he was trained in the ways of survival and combat. He learned to track and hunt, and to fight with a variety of weapons. As he grew older, he became a fierce warrior, and led his tribe in many successful hunts and battles.

One day, while out hunting, he was attacked by a group of bandits. He fought them off, but was gravely wounded in the process. He was found by a group of adventurers who were passing through the area, and they took him in and nursed him back to health. When he was well enough, he traveled with them for a while, learning more about the world and honing his skills in combat.

Eventually, he parted ways with the group and struck out on his own. He has since been wandering the land, helping those in need and fighting injustice wherever he finds it. He is a fierce warrior, and an even fiercer friend.
