She was born to a clan of dragonborn who resided in the mountains. When she was five, her parents were killed by a group of bandits who raided their village. She was the only one who survived. She was taken in by a group of druids who resided in the forest nearby. The druids taught her the ways of nature and how to commune with the spirits of the land. She eventually became a druid herself. When she was sixteen, she left the forest to find her own way in the world. She has been wandering ever since, using her druidic powers to help those in need. She has a deep connection to the natural world and the spirits that reside within it.
